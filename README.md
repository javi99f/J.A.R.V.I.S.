# J.A.R.V.I.S

JARVIS has two interfaces over the same Gemini Live runtime: a Raspberry Pi
touchscreen appliance and a native Windows 10/11 desktop assistant. The Pi
edition provides its full-screen HUD and hardware/home tools. The Windows
edition provides its transparent animated orb, selectable audio endpoints,
local history and memory, and constrained multi-step application control.

This customized branch adds a privacy-preserving local `Hey Jarvis` wake word,
a Siri-style follow-up conversation window, explicit audio-device selection,
microphone diagnostics, generic Bluetooth configuration, and a Raspberry Pi 4
installer. See `RASPBERRY_PI_4_TEST.md` for the physical test procedure.

The Windows edition can interact with ordinary applications and the default
browser within explicit safety limits. It blocks terminals, Registry Editor,
Windows settings, installers, arbitrary executable paths and critical system
shortcuts. It does not provide unrestricted file or system administration.
See `DESKTOP_WINDOWS.md` for installation, privacy boundaries and diagnostics.

## Features

- Real-time voice conversation through Gemini Live
- Full-screen PyQt6 HUD for a 10.1-inch vertical Raspberry Pi touchscreen
- Local wake-word standby; room audio is not sent to Gemini until activation
- Configurable follow-up conversation window (12 seconds by default)
- Speaker volume control, speaker mute/unmute, and optional generic Bluetooth reconnect helper
- Assistant listening mute/unmute with voice-safe wake phrases
- UI brightness dimming for HDMI touchscreens that do not expose Linux backlight control
- Optional Home Assistant controls for lights, lamps, LED strips, switches, and smart plugs
- Optional Zernio-powered Instagram/TikTok analytics through natural language
- Optional OpenRouter-backed public question answering and helper responses
- Secure remote updates from public GitHub Releases, with confirmation, backup, validation, and rollback
- Medium-depth reasoning with persistent, verifiable plans for genuinely complex multi-step tasks
- SQLite long-term memory with relevance retrieval, legacy JSON migration, secret filtering, and user controls to search, edit, and delete memories
- Native Windows installer with bundled dependencies and a packaged self-test
- Safe Windows browser/application interaction with local confirmation for consequential actions
- Local password-protected developer mode with redacted diagnostics, wake telemetry, personality/voice controls, and a tamper-evident audit

## Hardware You Need

- Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS with a desktop session
- 10.1-inch vertical display, recommended resolution 800x1200
- USB microphone
- Speaker output through USB, HDMI, Bluetooth, or 3.5 mm audio
- Internet access

## Accounts And Keys

Create one local setup file: `.env`.

That is the only file a normal user needs to edit for their own keys, URLs, and tokens. Copy it from `.env.example`, fill in their own values, and keep it private.

Required for both editions:

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - used for the live voice assistant

Optional:

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` - enables an optional helper backend; normal Gemini Live conversation does not require it
- `ZERNIO_API_KEY` - enables Instagram/TikTok analytics questions
- `HOME_ASSISTANT_URL` - your Home Assistant base URL
- `HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN` - a Home Assistant long-lived access token

Never commit `.env` or real credentials. This repo ignores `.env`, local config files, runtime state, memory JSON, logs, and PID files.

## Install On Windows

Use `dist-installer/Jarvis-Setup.exe`; no separate Python or dependency install
is required. On first launch, JARVIS shows a protected field for the user's own
Gemini key and a direct link to Google AI Studio. No shared API key is bundled.
See `DESKTOP_WINDOWS.md` for the complete Windows workflow.

## Install On Raspberry Pi

From a terminal on the Pi:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-venv python3-pip portaudio19-dev pulseaudio-utils
git clone <your-repo-url> omar-ai-core
cd omar-ai-core
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

All user-specific setup lives in `.env`.

Run it:

```bash
python -m omar_ai_core
```

Or use the launch script:

```bash
chmod +x launch_assistant.sh
./launch_assistant.sh
```

## Configure The Display

The HUD is designed for a portrait 800x1200 screen. If your display opens sideways, rotate it in Raspberry Pi OS display settings or set the display orientation from your Pi's screen configuration tool.

The app uses an in-app dim overlay for brightness because many HDMI touchscreens do not expose a hardware backlight device to Linux.

## Configure Audio

Check that Linux sees your microphone and speaker:

```bash
arecord -l
aplay -l
pactl list short sources
pactl list short sinks
```

Set the default output device from Raspberry Pi OS audio settings or with `pactl`. Then restart the assistant.

Voice commands for speaker output:

- "mute volume"
- "unmute volume"
- "set volume to 30 percent"
- "volume up"
- "volume down"

## Assistant Mute Vs Speaker Mute

The assistant has two separate mute systems so voice commands do not accidentally disable the wrong thing.

Assistant listening mute:

- "mute yourself"
- "stop listening"
- "JARVIS unmute"
- "JARVIS wake up"
- "JARVIS listen"

When listening mute is enabled, JARVIS ignores normal commands and only listens for the wake phrases above.

Speaker mute:

- "mute volume"
- "mute speaker"
- "unmute volume"
- "unmute speaker"

SSH fallback:

```bash
./assistantctl mute
./assistantctl unmute
./assistantctl status
```

## Home Assistant Setup

Home Assistant is optional. To enable it:

1. Open Home Assistant.
2. Go to your user profile.
3. Create a long-lived access token.
4. Add these values to `.env`:

```bash
HOME_ASSISTANT_URL=http://homeassistant.local:8123
HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN=your-home-assistant-long-lived-access-token
```

Example commands:

- "turn on the table lamp"
- "turn off the studio lights"
- "toggle the LED strip"
- "are the kitchen lights on?"
- "list my lights"

Supported Home Assistant entity domains include `light` and `switch`.

## Zernio Social Analytics Setup

Zernio is optional. Add your key to `.env`:

```bash
ZERNIO_API_KEY=your-zernio-api-key
```

Example questions:

- "How many followers do we have on Instagram?"
- "How did the last two Instagram posts perform?"
- "What was the average engagement rate?"
- "How many likes and comments did the latest TikTok get?"

## Optional Autostart

To start the assistant automatically when the Pi desktop opens:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
nano ~/.config/autostart/omar-ai-core.desktop
```

Paste this, changing the path if you cloned somewhere else:

```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Omar AI Core
Exec=/home/pi/omar-ai-core/launch_assistant.sh
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/omar-ai-core
Terminal=false
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
```

Reboot the Pi:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

## Remote Updates

Version 0.5.2 can check and install Raspberry Pi updates published through a
public GitHub repository. Configure the repository in `.env`:

```env
UPDATE_REPOSITORY=javi99f/J.A.R.V.I.S.
UPDATE_ALLOW_PRERELEASE=0
```

Then type or say "Busca actualizaciones de Jarvis", or press `UPDATE` on the
Pi interface. Installation always requires explicit confirmation. Local keys,
memory, visual settings, and audio configuration are preserved. See
`UPDATES_GITHUB.md` for the publishing and recovery workflow.

## Security Before Publishing

Before pushing this repo online:

```bash
git status --short
git check-ignore -v .env config/home_assistant.json config/api_keys.json memory/long_term.json memory/jarvis-memory.db
```

Confirm that `.env` and local JSON state files are ignored. If a real token was ever committed to an old git history, rotate that token and publish from a fresh git history.

For a public repo, users should only copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add their own credentials there. Do not add real tokens directly to Python files, README examples, or tracked config files.

## Troubleshooting

If JARVIS hears you once and then stops, unplug and replug the USB mic, confirm it appears in `arecord -l`, and restart the assistant.

If you do not hear responses, check the default audio sink in Raspberry Pi OS audio settings and test output with:

```bash
speaker-test -t wav -c 2
```

If Home Assistant commands do not work, verify `HOME_ASSISTANT_URL`, verify the long-lived token, and make sure the entity names match your Home Assistant devices.

If the screen opens in the wrong orientation, fix display rotation in Raspberry Pi OS first, then restart the assistant.
